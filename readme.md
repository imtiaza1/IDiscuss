# 🗣️ IDiscuss - Tech Forum

## 📝 Description

**IDiscuss** is an online **tech discussion forum** where users can participate in conversations by creating threads, posting comments, and interacting with others. This platform is focused on tech-related discussions, where users can create threads and comment on topics related to programming, development, AI, web technologies, and more. It features a user authentication system and an interactive, responsive design.

The project was created as part of my learning process, following tutorials on YouTube. The design is based on a random template that I came across. The platform allows users to log in, create threads, comment on threads, and engage in discussions about technology.

The system is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML** for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS** for styling and making the website visually appealing.
- **JavaScript** for adding interactivity to the website.
- **PHP** for server-side scripting and handling user actions.
- **SQL** for database management.
- **jQuery** for simplifying DOM manipulation.
- **Bootstrap** for creating a responsive design.
